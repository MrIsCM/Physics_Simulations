# ⚙️ Physics Simulation

A collection of interactive and visual simulations of classical and quantum physics phenomena. This repository is a personal project to explore, understand, and showcase physics using Python and numerical methods.  

🚧 The project is still a work in progress — improvements and new features are coming!

## 📦 Contents

### ⛓️ **Pendulums**
Simulates:
- **Simple Pendulum** – Basic harmonic motion.
- **Double Pendulum** – Demonstrates chaotic behavior.
- **N-Pendulum** – Generalized system with _n_ masses.

### 🌌 **N-body problem**
Simulates gravitational interactions:
- ☀️🌎🌕 **3-Body Problem** – Classical chaotic motion of three celestial bodies.
- 🌠 **N-Body Problem** – Extendable to many-body gravitational systems using numerical integration.

### 🏹 **Projectiles**
Simulates projectile motion under different drag forces:
- 🪂 **No Friction**
- 🌫️ **Linear Drag**
- 💨 **Quadratic Drag**

Visualizations illustrate trajectory, velocity, and acceleration over time.

### 🧠 **Schrödinger**
Numerically solves the 1D time-independent Schrödinger Equation for various potential functions:
- 📉 Potential functions (e.g., infinite square well, harmonic oscillator)
- 🧬 Wavefunctions and probability densities

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `sympy`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrIsCM/Physics_Simulations
cd Physics_Simulation
```
2. Set up a virtual enviroment (recommended), I personally use [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

```bash
conda create -n phys-sim
conda activate phys-sim
```

3. Install dependencies (optionally: manual install).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run any notebook.

## 📌 Notes
